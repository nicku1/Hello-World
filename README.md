New repository to learn how to use GitHub. Hello World!

Hey! I'm Nicku and I'm learning how to code, work on different platforms and other programming/IT stuff ;) I have started with Java course, so I know some basics. I started also web developing course with some front-end and back-end stuff, probably I will improve my skills at back-end section :3
